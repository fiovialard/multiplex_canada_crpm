   abstract = {Bayesian statistics is an approach to data analysis based on Bayes’ theorem, where available knowledge about parameters in a statistical model is updated with the information in observed data. The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior distribution. The posterior can also be used for making predictions about future events. This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection. Examples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields are provided, including in social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine and more. We propose strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist. Finally, we outline the impact of Bayesian analysis on artificial intelligence, a major goal in the next decade.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Estimates of the number of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are important for monitoring efforts aimed at preventing disease transmission, especially following the introduction of a highly effective treatment. This report provides updated estimates of HCV incidence, prevalence, undiagnosed proportion and treatment in Canada. METHODS: A combination of back calculation modelling and a modified version of the workbook method were used to estimate the incidence and prevalence of anti-HCV positive persons, the prevalence of chronic HCV infection and the undiagnosed proportion. The number of people treated for chronic HCV was estimated using administrative pharmaceutical data. RESULTS: An estimated 9,470 new infections occurred in 2019, corresponding to an incidence rate of 25 per 100,000 population, a 7.7% decrease since 2015. The estimated prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies in the Canadian population was 1.03% (plausible range: 0.83%-1.38%), and the estimated prevalence of chronic HCV was 0.54% (plausible range: 0.40%-0.79%). The overall proportion of anti-HCV positive persons who were undiagnosed was estimated at 24% of all infections, with individuals born between 1945 and 1975 being the priority population the most likely to be undiagnosed. An estimated 74,500 people with chronic HCV have been treated since the introduction of direct-acting antivirals in 2014. CONCLUSION: Estimates of HCV incidence and prevalence are key metrics to guide interventions and resource allocation. While our estimates show that HCV incidence has decreased in Canada in recent years and treatment of chronic HCV has continued to increase, ongoing efforts are required to reduce the burden of HCV in Canada.},

However, only approximately 50% of PWID are currently screened for HCV in Switzerland. At present, screening of PWID occurs in general practice via venepuncture. Compared to venepuncture, screening via rapid antibody saliva and dried blood spot (DBS) tests is well adapted to PWID, who typically have difficult venous access. The cost-effectiveness of an increased access screening programme of PWID (increased screening using rapid antibody saliva tests and DBS tests [semi-quantitative viraemia and viral genotype]) was analysed through a decision tree screening model combined with the outputs of a Markov treatment model. Sensitivity and scenario analyses examined the uncertainty of results. At a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of CHF 100 000 (USD 105 000) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), the increased access screening programme was cost-effective compared to current screening, with a base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CHF 7 940 (USD 8337) per QALY. The net monetary benefit was CHF 959 802 668 (USD 1 007 792 801) for the PWID population and CHF 94 469 (USD 99 192) per person. The increased access screening programme had a 97.0% probability of being cost-effective compared to the current screening method at the WTP threshold of CHF 100 000 (USD 105 000). The results showed an increased access screening programme that uses tests which are better suited to the PWID population to be more cost-effective, due to the increased uptake that rapid antibody saliva and DBS tests generate.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low-risk perception is an important barrier to the utilization of HIV services. In this context, offering an online platform for people to assess their risk of HIV and inform their decision to test can be impactful in increasing testing uptake. Using secondary data from the HIVSmart! quasirandomized trial, we aimed to identify predictors of HIV, develop a risk staging model for South African township populations, and validate it in combination with the HIVSmart! digital self-testing program. SETTING: Townships in Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS: Using Bayesian predictive projection, we identified predictors of HIV and constructed a risk assessment model that we validated in external data. RESULTS: Our analyses included 3095 participants from the HIVSmart! trial. We identified a model of 5 predictors (being unmarried, HIV testing history, having had sex with a partner living with HIV, dwelling situation, and education) that performed best during external validation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 89% credible intervals: 0.71, 0.68 to 0.72). The sensitivity of our HIV risk staging model was 91.0% (89.1% to 92.7%) and the specificity was 13.2% (8.5% to 19.8%) but increased when combined with a digital HIV self-testing program, the specificity was 91.6% (95.9% to 96.4%) and sensitivity remained similar at 90.9% (89.1% to 92.6%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first validated digital HIV risk assessment tool developed for South African township populations and the first study to evaluate the added value of a risk assessment tool with an app-based HIV self-testing program. Study findings are relevant for application of digital programs to improve utilization of HIV testing services.},

   abstract = {With a prevalence almost twice as high as the national average, people living in South African townships are particularly impacted by the HIV epidemic. Yet, it remains unclear how socioeconomic factors impact the risk of HIV infection within township populations. Our objective was to estimate the extent to which socioeconomic factors (dwelling situation, education, employment status, and monthly income) explain the risk of HIV in South African township populations, after controlling for behavioural and individual risk factors. Using Bayesian logistic regression, we analysed secondary data from a quasi-randomised trial which recruited participants (N = 3095) from townships located across three subdistricts of Cape Town. We controlled for individual factors (age, sex, marital status, testing history, HIV exposure, comorbidities, and tuberculosis infection) and behavioural factors (unprotected sex, sex with multiple partners, with sex workers, with a partner living with HIV, under the influence of alcohol or drugs), and accounted for the uncertainty due to missing data through multiple imputation. We found that residing in informal dwellings and not having post-secondary education increased the odds of HIV (aOR, 89% CrI: 1.34, 1.07–1.68 and 1.82, 1.29–2.61, respectively), after controlling for subdistrict of residence, individual, and behavioural factors. Additionally, our results suggest different pathways for how socioeconomic status (SES) affect HIV infection in males and female participants: while socioeconomic factors associated with lower SES seem to be associated with a decreased likelihood of having recently sough HIV testing among male participants, they are associated with increased sexual risk taking which, among female participants, increase the risk of HIV. Our analyses demonstrate that social determinants of health are at the root of the HIV epidemic and affect the risk of HIV in multiple ways. These findings stress the need for the deployment of programs that specifically address social determinants of health.},

   abstract = {Objective: Dijkstra et al recently described a risk- and symptom-based score moderately predictive for HIV seroconversion in the preceding 6–12 months in men who have sex with men (MSM) in Amsterdam. Our objective was to determine whether this “Amsterdam Score” could also predict for acute HIV infection (AHI) in MSM. Design and Setting: This study is a case–control analysis of a prospectively enrolled cohort of MSM who voluntarily presented for HIV testing in San Diego. The study sample was composed of MSM who screened HIV antibody-negative and then either tested positive with AHI [HIV nucleic acid test (NAT)-positive] or tested HIV NAT-negative. Methods: The Amsterdam Score was calculated for each participant in the study sample. Score performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves and their area under the curve (AUC). An optimal cutoff was determined using the Youden index. Results: Seven hundred fifty-seven MSM (110 AHI and 647 HIV NAT-negative) were included in the analysis. AHI and HIV-negative cases were similar in age [median 32 years (interquartile range 26–42) vs 33 (27–45), respectively, P = 0.082]. The Amsterdam Score yielded a receiver operating characteristic curve with an AUC of 0.88 (95% confidence interval: 0.84 to 0.91). An optimal cutoff of ≥1.6 was 78.2% sensitive and 81.0% specific. Conclusions: The risk- and symptom-based Amsterdam Score was highly predictive (AUC of 0.88) of AHI in MSM in San Diego. The Amsterdam Score could be used to target NAT utilization in resource-poor settings among MSM who test HIV antibody-negative, although the potential cost-savings must be balanced with the risk of missing AHI diagnoses.},

   abstract = {Objective: Individuals with acute (preseroconversion) HIV infection (AHI) are important in the spread of HIV. The identification of AHI requires the detection of viral proteins or nucleic acids with techniques that are often unaffordable for routine use. To facilitate the efficient use of these tests, we sought to develop a risk score algorithm for identifying likely AHI cases and targeting the tests towards those individuals. Design: A cross-sectional study of 1448 adults attending a sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinic in Malawi. Methods: Using logistic regression, we identified risk behaviors, symptoms, HIV rapid test results, and STI syndromes that were predictive of AHI. We assigned a model-based score to each predictor and calculated a risk score for each participant. Results: Twenty-one participants (1.45%) had AHI, 588 had established HIV infection, and 839 were HIV-negative. AHI was strongly associated with discordant rapid HIV tests and genital ulcer disease (GUD). The algorithm also included diarrhea, more than one sexual partner in 2 months, body ache, and fever. Corresponding predictor scores were 1 for fever, body ache, and more than one partner; 2 for diarrhea and GUD; and 4 for discordant rapid tests. A risk score of 2 or greater was 95.2% sensitive and 60.5% specific in detecting AHI. Conclusion: Using this algorithm, we could identify 95% of AHI cases by performing nucleic acid or protein tests in only 40% of patients. Risk score algorithms could enable rapid, reliable AHI detection in resource-limited settings.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) have elevated infectivity, but cannot be diagnosed using antibody-based testing. Approaches to screen patients for AHI are urgently needed to enable counselling and treatment to reduce onward transmission. METHODS: We pooled data from four African studies of high-risk adults that evaluated symptoms and signs compatible with acute retroviral syndrome and tested for HIV-1 at each visit. AHI was defined as detectable plasma viral load or p24 antigen in an HIV-1-antibody-negative patient who subsequently seroconverted. Using generalized estimating equation, we identified symptoms, signs, and demographic factors predictive of AHI, adjusting for study site. We assigned a predictor score to each statistically significant predictor based on its beta coefficient, summing predictor scores to calculate a risk score for each participant. We evaluated the performance of this algorithm overall and at each site. RESULTS: We compared 122 AHI visits with 45 961 visits by uninfected patients. Younger age (18-29 years), fever, fatigue, body pains, diarrhoea, sore throat, and genital ulcer disease were independent predictors of AHI. The overall area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) for the algorithm was 0.78, with site-specific AUCs ranging from 0.61 to 0.89. A risk score of at least 2 would indicate AHI testing for 5-50% of participants, substantially decreasing the number needing testing. CONCLUSION: Our targeted risk score algorithm based on seven characteristics reduced the number of patients needing AHI testing and had good performance overall. We recommend this risk score algorithm for use by HIV programs in sub-Saharan Africa with capacity to test high-risk patients for AHI.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although health economic evaluations (HEEs) are increasingly common for therapeutic interventions, they appear to be rare for the use of risk prediction models (PMs). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the current state of HEEs of PMs by performing a comprehensive systematic review. METHODS: Four databases were searched for HEEs of PM-based strategies. Two reviewers independently selected eligible articles. A checklist was compiled to score items focusing on general characteristics of HEEs of PMs, model characteristics and quality of HEEs, evidence on PMs typically used in the HEEs, and the specific challenges in performing HEEs of PMs. RESULTS: After screening 791 abstracts, 171 full texts, and reference checking, 40 eligible HEEs evaluating 60 PMs were identified. In these HEEs, PM strategies were compared with current practice (n = 32; 80%), to other stratification methods for patient management (n = 19; 48%), to an extended PM (n = 9; 23%), or to alternative PMs (n = 5; 13%). The PMs guided decisions on treatment (n = 42; 70%), further testing (n = 18; 30%), or treatment prioritization (n = 4; 7%). For 36 (60%) PMs, only a single decision threshold was evaluated. Costs of risk prediction were ignored for 28 (46%) PMs. Uncertainty in outcomes was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analyses in 22 (55%) HEEs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the huge number of PMs in the medical literature, HEE of PMs remains rare. In addition, we observed great variety in their quality and methodology, which may complicate interpretation of HEE results and implementation of PMs in practice. Guidance on HEE of PMs could encourage and standardize their application and enhance methodological quality, thereby improving adequate use of PM strategies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) can be used in sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing environments to prioritize individuals at the highest risk of infection and optimize resource allocation. We previously derived a CPR to predict asymptomatic chlamydia and/or gonorrhea (CT/NG) infection among women and heterosexual men at in-person STI clinics based on 5 predictors. Population differences between clinic-based and Internet-based testers may limit the tool's application across settings. The primary objective of this study was to assess the validity, sensitivity, and overall performance of this CPR within an Internet-based testing environment (GetCheckedOnline.com). METHODS: We analyzed GetCheckedOnline online risk assessment and laboratory data from October 2015 to June 2019. We compared the STI clinic population used for CPR derivation (data previously published) and the GetCheckedOnline validation population using χ2 tests. Calibration and discrimination were assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and the area under the receiver operating curve, respectively. Sensitivity and the fraction of total screening tests offered were quantified for CPR-predicted risk scores. RESULTS: Asymptomatic CT/NG infection prevalence in the GetCheckedOnline population (n = 5478) was higher than in the STI clinic population (n = 10,437; 2.4% vs. 1.8%, P = 0.007). When applied to GetCheckedOnline, the CPR had reasonable calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow, P = 0.90) and discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic, 0.64). By screening only individuals with total risk scores ≥4, we would detect 97% of infections and reduce screening by 14%. CONCLUSIONS: The application of an existing CPR to detect asymptomatic CT/NG infection is valid within an Internet-based STI testing environment. Clinical prediction rules applied online can reduce unnecessary STI testing and optimize resource allocation within publicly funded health systems.},

   abstract = {Machine learning is increasingly introduced into medical fields, yet there is limited evidence for its benefit over more commonly used statistical methods in epidemiological studies. We introduce an unsupervised machine learning framework for longitudinal features and evaluate it using sexual behaviour data from the last 20 years from over 3'700 participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). We use hierarchical clustering to find subgroups of men who have sex with men in the SHCS with similar sexual behaviour up to May 2017, and apply regression to test whether these clusters enhance predictions of sexual behaviour or sexually transmitted diseases (STIs) after May 2017 beyond what can be predicted with conventional parameters. We find that behavioural clusters enhance model performance according to likelihood ratio test, Akaike information criterion and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for all outcomes studied, and according to Bayesian information criterion for five out of ten outcomes, with particularly good performance for predicting future sexual behaviour and recurrent STIs. We thus assess a methodology that can be used as an alternative means for creating exposure categories from longitudinal data in epidemiological models, and can contribute to the understanding of time-varying risk factors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends testing all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients for hepatitis C virus (HCV). In resource-constrained contexts with low-to-intermediate HCV prevalence among HIV patients, as in Cambodia, targeted testing is, in the short-term, potentially more feasible and cost-effective. AIM: To develop a clinical prediction score (CPS) to risk-stratify HIV patients for HCV coinfection (HCV RNA detected), and derive a decision rule to guide prioritization of HCV testing in settings where 'testing all' is not feasible or unaffordable in the short term. METHODS: We used data of a cross-sectional HCV diagnostic study in the HIV cohort of Sihanouk Hospital Center of Hope in Phnom Penh. Key populations were very rare in this cohort. Score development relied on the Spiegelhalter and Knill-Jones method. Predictors with an adjusted likelihood ratio ≥ 1.5 or ≤ 0.67 were retained, transformed to natural logarithms, and rounded to integers as score items. CPS performance was evaluated by the area-under-the-ROC curve (AUROC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and diagnostic accuracy at the different cut-offs. For the decision rule, HCV coinfection probability ≥1% was agreed as test-threshold. RESULTS: Among the 3045 enrolled HIV patients, 106 had an HCV coinfection. Of the 11 candidate predictors (from history-taking, laboratory testing), seven had an adjusted likelihood ratio ≥ 1.5 or ≤ 0.67: ≥ 50 years (+1 point), diabetes mellitus (+1), partner/household member with liver disease (+1), generalized pruritus (+1), platelets < 200 × 10(9)/L (+1), aspartate transaminase (AST) < 30 IU/L (-1), AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) ≥ 0.45 (+1), and APRI < 0.45 (-1). The AUROC was 0.84 (95%CI: 0.80-0.89), indicating good discrimination of HCV/HIV coinfection and HIV mono-infection. The CPS result ≥0 best fits the test-threshold (negative predictive value: 99.2%, 95%CI: 98.8-99.6). Applying this threshold, 30% (n = 926) would be tested. Sixteen coinfections (15%) would have been missed, none with advanced fibrosis. CONCLUSION: The CPS performed well in the derivation cohort, and bears potential for other contexts of low-to-intermediate prevalence and little onward risk of transmission(i.e. cohorts without major risk factors as injecting drug use, men having sex with men), and where available resources do not allow to test all HIV patients as recommended by WHO. However, the score requires external validation in other patient cohorts before any wider use can be considered.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections (STI) are frequent among men who have sex with men (MSM). Identifying asymptomatic STIs is a crucial issue, not only for secondary but also for primary prevention, as early treatment can reduce transmission risk. We aimed to develop a self-reported predictive score for early identification of asymptomatic STIs. METHODS: Participants provided clinical data and completed a self-administered questionnaire including sociodemographic variables and behaviors during the 6 previous months. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with asymptomatic STIs. We calculated the accuracy of the model by the non-parametric area (AUC) under the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve to find the optimal discriminant threshold for screening. RESULTS: A total of 781 HIV-positive MSM were included with a mean age of 46.8 years. Asymptomatic STI prevalence was 13.2%. Detectable plasma HIV RNA (adjusted odds ratio (aOR [95% CI): 2.54 [1.23;5.25]), inconsistent condom use during anal sex (2.20 [1.36;3.56]), group sex (2.00 [1.15;3.45]), during or-genital practices (1.83 [1.12;3.01]), not being in stable relationship (1.70 [1.01;2.66] and an item from a sensation-seeking behavioral scale "I don't like watching porn videos" (1.61 [1.01;2.59] were associated with asymptomatic STI. AUC was 0.7 and with optimal threshold of 0.1082 for this model; sensitivity was 80.4%. Self-reported asymptomatic STI predictive score was built with this threshold according to the 6 factors in the final model. CONCLUSIONS: As this predictive score is not designed to be diagnostic, but to provide indications for diagnostic tests, its ease of administration and sensitivity remain the most important features. Its use in clinical practice for early detection of asymptomatic STIs potentially can reinforce STI primary and secondary prevention.},

The actual prevalence of blood borne viruses in Australian potential organ donors, and the predictive performance of questionnaires administered to stratify this risk, remains unknown. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who commenced workup for donation on the national database between 2014-2020. The prevalence of HIV, Active HBV and Active HCV in 3650 potential organ donors was 0.16%, 0.9%, and 2.2%, respectively. The behavioural risk profile was assessed in a subset of 3633 patients. Next-of-kin reported increased risk behaviours were associated with an increased prevalence of HCV but not of HIV or HBV (OR 13.8, p < 0.01, OR 0.3. p = 0.42, OR 1.5, p = 0.14). Furthermore, the majority of HIV and HBV infections occurred in potential donors without a disclosed history of increased risk behaviours. In this series, donors had a higher prevalence of HCV, and similar rates of HBV and HIV to the broader community. Behavioural transmission risks were poorly predictive of HIV and HBV. Rather than pre-transplantation behavioural risk screening, routine post-transplant recipient screening may provide a more powerful tool in mitigating the consequences of unexpected viral transmission.},

   abstract = {Machine learning algorithms are excellent techniques to develop prediction models to enhance response and efficiency in the health sector. It is the greatest approach to avoid the spread of hepatitis C, especially injecting drugs, is to avoid these behaviors. Treatments for hepatitis C can cure most patients within 8 to 12 weeks, so being tested is critical. After examining multiple types of machine learning approaches to construct the classification models, we built an AI-based ensemble model for predicting Hepatitis C disease in patients with the capacity to predict advanced fibrosis by integrating clinical data and blood biomarkers. The dataset included a variety of factors related to Hepatitis C disease. The training data set was subjected to three machine-learning approaches and the validated data was then used to evaluate the ensemble learning-based prediction model. The results demonstrated that the proposed ensemble learning model has been observed ad more accurate compared to the existing Machine learning algorithms. The Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) technique was the most precise learning approach (94.1% accuracy). The Bayesian network was the second-most accurate learning algorithm (94.47% accuracy). The accuracy improved to the level of 95.59%. Hepatitis C has a significant frequency globally, and the disease's development can result in irreparable damage to the liver, as well as death. As a result, utilizing AI-based ensemble learning model for its prediction is advantageous in curbing the risks and improving treatment outcome. The study demonstrated that the use of ensemble model presents more precision or accuracy in predicting Hepatitis C disease instead of using individual algorithms. It also shows how an AI-based ensemble model could be used to diagnose Hepatitis C disease with greater accuracy.},

A clinical prediction rule (CPR) may help target resources using psychosocial questions as an acceptable, effective means of assessment. The aim was to derive a CPR that discriminates women who would benefit from sexual health discussion and intervention. Participants were recruited to a cross-sectional survey from six GPs in a city in South-East England in 2016. On arrival, female patients aged 16–44 years were invited to complete a questionnaire that addressed psychosocial factors, and the following self-reported outcomes: 2+ sexual partners in the last year (2PP) and RUIP. For each sexual risk, psychosocial questions were retained from logistic regression modelling which best discriminated women at risk using the C-statistic. Sensitivity and specificity were established in consultation with GP staff. The final sample comprised N = 1238 women. 2PP was predicted by 11 questions including age, binge-drinking weekly, ever having a partner who insulted you often, current smoking, and not cohabiting (C-statistic = 0.83, sensitivity = 73% and specificity = 77%). RUIP was predicted by 5 questions including sexual debut <16 years, and emergency contraception use in the last 6 months (C-statistic = 0.70, sensitivity = 69% and specificity = 57%). 2PP was better discriminated than RUIP but neither to a clinically-useful degree. The finding that different psychosocial factors predicted each outcome has implications for prevention strategies. Further research should investigate causal links between psychosocial factors and sexual risk.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A clinical prediction rule (CPR) using psychosocial questions was previously derived to target sexual healthcare in general practice by identifying women at risk of unintended pregnancy (UIP) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This psychosocial CPR may help target resources within contraception and sexual health (CASH) services. This study investigated how well it predicted recent self-reported risk of UIP and STI acquisition among women attending a CASH clinic. METHODS: Female patients aged 16-44 years attending a CASH clinic in South-East England were offered a questionnaire on arrival. This comprised psychosocial questions, and others addressing three sexual risks: (1) two or more male sexual partners in the last year (2+P), (2) risk of STI acquisition through most recent partner and (3) risk of UIP in the last 6 months. A CPR score was calculated for each participant and cross-tabulated against self-report of each sexual risk to estimate CPR sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: The psychosocial questions predicting 2+P had sensitivity 83.2% (95% CI 79.3% to 86.5%) and specificity 56.1% (95% CI 51.3%-60.6%). Those predicting combined 2+P and/or risk of STI acquisition through most recent partner had a sensitivity of 89.1% (95% CI 85.7%-91.8%) and specificity of 43.7% (95% CI 39.0%-48.5%). Questions predicting risk of UIP in the last 6 months had a sensitivity of 82.5% (95% CI 78.6%-86.0%) and specificity of 48.3% (95% CI 43.4%-53.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The CPR demonstrated good sensitivity but low specificity, so may be suited to triaging or stratifying which interventions to offer CASH patients and by which mode (eg, online vs face-to-face). Further investigation of causal links between psychosocial factors and sexual risk is warranted to support development of psychosocial interventions for this patient group.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pharyngeal Chlamydia trachomatis in women might contribute to autoinoculation and transmission to sexual partners. Data for effectiveness of different testing practices for pharyngeal C trachomatis are scarce. We therefore aimed to assess the prevalence of pharyngeal C trachomatis, determinants, and effectiveness of different testing practices in women. METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study, in which surveillance data for all women visiting sexually transmitted infection clinics in all regions in the Netherlands between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2017, were used. We collected consultation-level data and individual-level data from 2016 onwards for sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviour in the past 6 months, self-reported symptoms, and STI diagnoses. The primary outcome was the positivity rate of pharyngeal C trachomatis infection compared between routine universal testing (>85% tested pharyngeally per clinic year), selective testing (5-85% tested pharyngeally per clinic year), and incidental testing (<5% pharyngeally tested per clinic year). We calculated the number of missed infections by extrapolating the positivity rate assessed by routine universal testing to all selectively tested women. We used multivariable generalised estimating equations logistic regression analyses to assess independent risk factors for pharyngeal C trachomatis and used the assessed risk factors as testing indicators for comparing alternative testing scenarios. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2017, a total of 550 615 consultations with at least one C trachomatis test was recorded, of which 541 945 (98·4%) consultations (including repeat visits) were included in this analysis. Pharyngeal C trachomatis positivity was lower in the routine universal testing group than in the selective testing group (1081 [2·4%; 95% CI 2·2-2·5] of 45 774 vs 3473 [2·9%; 2·8-3·0] of 121 262; p<0·0001). The positivity rate was also higher among consultations done in the incidental testing group (44 [4·1%; 95% CI 3·1-5·5] of 1073; p<0·0001) than in the routine universal testing group. Based on extrapolation, selective testing would have hypothetically missed 64·4% (95% CI 63·5-65·3; 6363 of 9879) of the estimated total of C trachomatis infections. The proportion of pharyngeal-only C trachomatis was comparable between routinely universally tested women (22·9%) and selectively tested women (20·4%), resulting in a difference of 2·5% (95% CI -0·3 to 5·3; p=0·07). When using risk factors for pharyngeal C trachomatis as testing indicators, 15 484 (79·6%) of 19 459 women would be tested to detect 398 (80·6%) of 494 infections. INTERPRETATION: No optimal testing scenario was available for pharyngeal C trachomatis, in which only a selection of high-risk women needs to be tested to find most pharyngeal C trachomatis infections. The relative low prevalence of pharyngeal-only C trachomatis (0·5%) and probably limited clinical and public health effect do not provide support for routine universal testing.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been considerable interest in the development of innovative service delivery modules for prioritizing resources in sexual health delivery in response to dwindling fiscal resources and rising infection rates. METHODS: This study aims to derive and validate a risk scoring algorithm to accurately identify asymptomatic patients at increased risk for chlamydia and/or gonorrhea infection. We examined the electronic records of patient visits at sexual health clinics in Vancouver, Canada. We derived risk scores from regression coefficients of multivariable logistic regression model using visits between 2000 and 2006. We evaluated the model's discrimination, calibration, and screening performance. Temporal validation was assessed in visits from 2007 to 2012. RESULTS: The prevalence of infection was 1.8% (n = 10,437) and 2.1% (n = 14,956) in the derivation and validation data sets, respectively. The final model included younger age, nonwhite ethnicity, multiple sexual partners, and previous infection and showed reasonable performance in the derivation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.74; Hosmer-Lemeshow P = 0.91) and validation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.64; Hosmer-Lemeshow P = 0.36) data sets. A risk score cutoff point of at least 6 detected 91% and 83% of cases by screening 68% and 68% of the derivation and validation populations, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the use of the algorithm for individualized risk assessment and have important implications for reducing unnecessary screening and saving costs. Specifically, we anticipate that the algorithm has potential uses in alternative settings such as Internet-based testing contexts by facilitating personalized test recommendations, stimulating health care-seeking behavior, and aiding risk communication by increasing sexually transmitted infection risk perception through the creation of tailored risk messages to different groups.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C is a prevalent disease that poses a high risk to the human liver. Early diagnosis of hepatitis C is crucial for treatment and prognosis. Therefore, developing an effective medical decision system is essential. In recent years, many computational methods have been proposed to identify hepatitis C patients. Although existing hepatitis prediction models have achieved good results in terms of accuracy, most of them are black-box models and cannot gain the trust of doctors and patients in clinical practice. As a result, this study aims to use various Machine Learning (ML) models to predict whether a patient has hepatitis C, while also using explainable models to elucidate the prediction process of the ML models, thus making the prediction process more transparent. RESULT: We conducted a study on the prediction of hepatitis C based on serological testing and provided comprehensive explanations for the prediction process. Throughout the experiment, we modeled the benchmark dataset, and evaluated model performance using fivefold cross-validation and independent testing experiments. After evaluating three types of black-box machine learning models, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and AdaBoost, we adopted Bayesian-optimized RF as the classification algorithm. In terms of model interpretation, in addition to using common SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide global explanations for the model, we also utilized the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations with stability (LIME_stabilitly) to provide local explanations for the model. CONCLUSION: Both the fivefold cross-validation and independent testing show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method. IHCP maintains excellent model interpretability while obtaining excellent predictive performance. This helps uncover potential predictive patterns of the model and enables clinicians to better understand the model's decision-making process.},

The aim of this study was to develop and test the psychometric properties of the Sexual Risk Behaviors Scale (SRBS), a novel short tool for measuring engagement in sexual risk behaviors in university students. We developed a pool of six items based on a review of recent literature and tested its properties in 547 undergraduate students in the United Kingdom. We used Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis to explore and determine the factor structure and dimensionality of the SRBS. We used Item Response Theory and specifically the Graded Response Model to investigate items' discrimination, information, and differential functioning, respectively, and logistic regression to test whether higher SRBS scores predicted a diagnosis of any sexually transmitted infections in the past 12 months. Results showed that a unidimensional, five-item model fitted the data well, showing satisfactory fit indices and reliability, with all items providing adequate discrimination and information, and no differential item functioning by gender nor by sexual orientation. SRBS total scores significantly predicted the odds of being diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections in the past 12 months. Implications for public health prevention and intervention are discussed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: People who use drugs (PWUD) are among those with the highest risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Highly effective direct-acting antiviral agents offer an opportunity to eliminate HCV. A simple tool for the prediction of HCV infection risk in PWUD is urgently needed. This study aimed to develop and validate a risk prediction tool to identify people at greater risk of having hepatitis C among PWUD that is applicable in resource-limited settings. METHODS: We extracted data from national HIV/AIDS sentinel surveillance in PWUD (Zhejiang Province, 2016-2021) and developed and validated a risk score to improve HCV testing in PWUD. This risk score consists of seven risk factors identified using multivariable logistic regression modeling (2016-2020, exploratory group). We validated this score using surveillance data for 2021 (validation group). The accuracy of the model was determined using C-statistics. RESULTS: We identified seven risk factors, including sex, age, marital status, educational attainment, and the use of heroin, morphine, and methamphetamine. In the exploratory group, the positive rates of detecting the HCV antibody in the low-risk (0-9 points), intermediate-risk (10-16 points), and high-risk (≥17 points) groups were 6.72%, 17.24%, and 38.02%, respectively (P(trend) < 0.001). In the validation group, the positive rates in the low-, medium-, and high-risk groups were 4.46%, 12.23%, and 38.99%, respectively (P(trend) < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a drug-specific risk prediction tool for identifying PWUD at increased risk of HCV infection. This tool can complement and integrate the screening strategy for the purpose of early diagnosis and treatment.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the predictive performances of four machine learning-based models for the prediction of HBV and HCV status. (2) Methods: This prospective cohort screening study evaluated adults from the North-Eastern and South-Eastern regions of Romania between January 2022 and November 2022 who underwent viral hepatitis screening in their family physician's offices. The patients' clinical characteristics were extracted from a structured survey and were included in four machine learning-based models: support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), naïve Bayes (NB), and K nearest neighbors (KNN), and their predictive performance was assessed. (3) Results: All evaluated models performed better when used to predict HCV status. The highest predictive performance was achieved by KNN algorithm (accuracy: 98.1%), followed by SVM and RF with equal accuracies (97.6%) and NB (95.7%). The predictive performance of these models was modest for HBV status, with accuracies ranging from 78.2% to 97.6%. (4) Conclusions: The machine learning-based models could be useful tools for HCV infection prediction and for the risk stratification process of adult patients who undergo a viral hepatitis screening program.},

Given the frequently asymptomatic nature of hepatitis and the challenges associated with screening in some vulnerable populations such as diabetes patients, we conducted an investigation into the performance of various machine learning models for the identification of hepatitis in diabetic patients while also evaluating the significance of features. Analyzing NHANES data from 2013 to 2018, machine learning models were evaluated; random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) along with stacked ensemble model. We performed hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of the model, and selected important predictors using the best performance model. LASSO showed the highest predictive performance (AUC-ROC = 0.810) rather than other models. Illicit drug use, poverty, and race were highly ranked as predictive factors for developing hepatitis in diabetes patients. Our study demonstrated that a machine-learning-based model performed optimally in the detection of hepatitis among diabetes patients, achieving high performance. Furthermore, models and predictors evaluated from the current study, we expect, could be supportive information for developing screening or treatment methods for hepatitis care in diabetes patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND : Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) are the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) worldwide. In the absence of affordable point-of-care STI tests, WHO recommends STI testing based on risk factors. This study aimed to develop a prediction tool with a sensitivity of > 90% and efficiency (defined as the percentage of individuals that are eligible for diagnostic testing) of < 60%. METHODS: This study offered CT/NG testing as part of a cluster-randomised trial of community-based delivery of sexual and reproductive health services to youth aged 16-24 years in Zimbabwe. All individuals accepting STI testing completed an STI risk factor questionnaire. The outcome was positivity for either CT or NG. Backwards-stepwise logistic regression was performed with p ≥ 0.05 as criteria for exclusion. Coefficients of variables included in the final multivariable model were multiplied by 10 to generate weights for a STI risk prediction tool. A maximum likelihood Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) model was fitted, with the continuous variable score divided into 15 categories of equal size. Sensitivity, efficiency and number needed to screen were calculated for different cut-points. RESULTS: From 3 December 2019 to 5 February 2020, 1007 individuals opted for STI testing, of whom 1003 (99.6%) completed the questionnaire. CT/NG prevalence was 17.5% (95% CI 15.1, 19.8) (n = 175). CT/NG positivity was independently associated with being female, number of lifetime sexual partners, relationship status, HIV status, self-assessed STI risk and past or current pregnancy. The STI risk prediction score including those variables ranged from 2 to 46 with an area under the ROC curve of 0.72 (95% CI 0.68, 0.76). Two cut-points were chosen: (i) 23 for optimised sensitivity (75.9%) and specificity (59.3%) and (ii) 19 to maximise sensitivity (82.4%) while keeping efficiency at < 60% (59.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of STIs among youth, even in those with no or one reported risk factor, may preclude the use of risk prediction tools for selective STI testing. At a cut-point of 19 one in six young people with STIs would be missed.},

We assessed performance of an existing RTI risk assessment screening tool among women living with HIV (WLHIV) considering intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) use. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis among WLHIV screened for participation in an IUC trial in Cape Town, South Africa (NCT01721798). RTI testing included Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis. Tool scoring was based on five separately scored criteria: (1) age under 25 years, (2) cohabitation with a partner, (3) secondary education, (4) self-reported intermenstrual bleeding and (5) number of current sexual partners and condom use frequency (score 0-5). We assessed tool performance in detecting RTI at 0 vs 1-5, 0-1 vs 2-5 and 0-2 vs 3-5 score thresholds. RESULTS: Of 303 women, 52% (n=157) reported antiretroviral therapy use and median age was 31 years. The prevalence of any RTI was 38% (gonorrhoea=7%, chlamydia=11%, trichomoniasis=12% and bacterial vaginosis=18%) and 8% of women had multiple RTIs. Overall, 4%, 27% and 69% of women had screening tool scores of 0, 1 or 2+, respectively. At a threshold of at least one scored criterion, the tool demonstrated high sensitivities (95%-97%) but low specificities (3%-4%) for detecting any RTI. Increasing the score threshold and/or inclusion of abnormal vaginal discharge marginally improved specificity. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of RTIs observed in this population was high, and the screening tool had no discriminatory power to detect prevalent RTIs.},

   abstract = {Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation. Annually, approximately 3.4 million cases of HCV are reported worldwide. A diagnosis of HCV in earlier stages helps to save lives. In the HCV review, the authors used a single ML-based prediction model in the current research, which encounters several issues, i.e., poor accuracy, data imbalance, and overfitting. This research proposed a Hybrid Predictive Model (HPM) based on an improved random forest and support vector machine to overcome existing research limitations. The proposed model improves a random forest method by adding a bootstrapping approach. The existing RF method is enhanced by adding a bootstrapping process, which helps eliminate the tree's minor features iteratively to build a strong forest. It improves the performance of the HPM model. The proposed HPM model utilizes a 'Ranker method' to rank the dataset features and applies an IRF with SVM, selecting higher-ranked feature elements to build the prediction model. This research uses the online HCV dataset from UCI to measure the proposed model's performance. The dataset is highly imbalanced; to deal with this issue, we utilized the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE). This research performs two experiments. The first experiment is based on data splitting methods, K-fold cross-validation, and training: testing-based splitting. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 95.89% for k = 5 and 96.29% for k = 10; for the training and testing-based split, the proposed method achieved 91.24% for 80:20 and 92.39% for 70:30, which is the best compared to the existing SVM, MARS, RF, DT, and BGLM methods. In experiment 2, the analysis is performed using feature selection (with SMOTE and without SMOTE). The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 41.541% without SMOTE and 96.82% with SMOTE-based feature selection, which is better than existing ML methods. The experimental results prove the importance of feature selection to achieve higher accuracy in HCV research.},

   abstract = {Despite the effectiveness of available treatments, hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a major public health problem, mainly due to the high percentage of undiagnosed individuals. We aim to create an easy-to-implement risk score to facilitate targeted HCV testing in the general population. This is a substudy derived from a prospective study in primary care in Madrid (Spain). Participants completed a 21-question risk assessment questionnaire, followed by HCV testing for those with at least one positive response and those >50 years of age, even if they did not answer positively. We used the population >50 years of age to fit a logistic regression model to create a score predicting the risk of a positive test result. We then performed a sensitivity analysis by applying the score obtained to the population <50 years of age, to assess its diagnostic accuracy. Data collected from 2,302 participants were included in the analysis. The prevalence of HCV infection was 1.3%. Five items were selected, showing a C-statistic of 0.896, i.e., male sex, Eastern European origin, use of intravenous drugs, self-perceived risk of acquired HCV infection, and past hepatitis or unexplained liver disease. The sensitivity was 98%, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.05 for participants with scores of 0 (49.8% in our sample), ruling out HCV infection with high probability. We obtained similar estimates in the population <50 years of age. This tool achieved high diagnostic accuracy to target HCV testing. This could help optimize resources when universal screening is not feasible. IMPORTANCE Despite the highly effective treatments currently available, HCV remains one of the major public health problems related to an infectious agent, mainly because a high percentage of individuals remain undiagnosed. Universal screening has been proposed as a way to end this epidemic; however, it is not feasible in all settings due to different implementation barriers. With this work, we aim to collaborate in improving the diagnosis of HCV infection by creating a simple 5-item score that rules out HCV infection with a very high probability. Almost one-half of the participants in our sample did not present any affirmative answers to these questions, and their probability of being infected was close to 0%. This tool could be a useful strategy and could be considered a cost-effective alternative to optimize resources when universal screening is not feasible.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Syphilis incidence is rising among men who have sex with men (MSM). An online tool based on a risk score identifying men with higher risk of infectious syphilis could motivate MSM to seek care. We aimed therefore to develop a symptoms-based risk score for infectious syphilis. METHODS: We included data from all consultations by MSM attending the Amsterdam Centre for Sexual Health in 2018-2019. Infectious syphilis (ie, primary, secondary or early latent syphilis) was diagnosed according to the centre's routine protocol. Associations between symptoms and infectious syphilis were expressed as odds ratios (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Based on multivariable logistic regression models, we created risk scores, combining various symptoms. We assessed the area under the curve (AUC) and cut-off based on the Youden Index. We estimated which percentage of MSM should be tested based on a positive risk score and which percentage of infectious syphilis cases would then be missed. RESULTS: We included 21,646 consultations with 11,594 unique persons. The median age was 34 years (IQR 27-45), and 14% were HIV positive (93% on antiretroviral treatment). We diagnosed 538 cases of infectious syphilis. Associations with syphilis symptoms/signs were strong and highly significant, for example, OR for a painless penile ulcer was 35.0 (CI 24.9 to 49.2) and OR for non-itching rash 57.8 (CI 36.8 to 90.9). Yet, none of the individual symptoms or signs had an AUC >0.55. The AUC of risk scores combining various symptoms varied from 0.68 to 0.69. For all risk scores using cut-offs based on Youden Index, syphilis screening would be recommended in 6% of MSM, and 59% of infectious syphilis cases would be missed. CONCLUSION: Symptoms-based risk scores for infectious syphilis perform poorly and cannot be recommended to select MSM for syphilis screening. All MSM with relevant sexual exposure should be regularly tested for syphilis.},

   abstract = {Despite the ongoing transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV, many people became unable to access testing due to COVID-19. To address this, we created a mail-out HIV self-test kit, which could be delivered without restrictions in our region. The uptake and feedback from this project made us realize that comprehensive STI testing was being sought. To ensure testing occurred correctly-that is, it would be targeted at the persons most affected by STIs/HIV-we automated clinical decision-making. We built this model based on a 2-by-2 matrix that plots the risk of STI/HIV transmission and risk of STI/HIV exposure. The intercept of these two measures classifies a person as low, medium, or high risk. After automating this logic, 16 expert clinicians in STI/HIV care tested this system with over 400 test patient cases and refined the algorithm until it yielded the exact outcomes that these clinicians would offer patients based on guidelines. Findings of interest are that the scale of the y-axis is exponential, in that risk factors for exposure do not climb cumulatively but do so according to a quadratic equation. This helps ensure that testing services are targeted at those who are most inequitably burdened by these infections.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Availability of laboratory confirmation of sexually transmitted infections is increasing in low- and middle-income countries, but costs continue to limit their access. Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is a sexually transmitted infection of significant clinical importance, particularly among women. This study aimed to develop a risk score to identify women with a higher likelihood of CT infection, who could then be prioritized for laboratory testing, in a population of Kenyan women planning pregnancies. METHODS: Women with fertility intentions were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios for the association between demographic, medical, reproductive, and behavioral characteristics and the prevalence of CT infection. A risk score was developed and validated internally based on the regression coefficients in the final multivariable model. RESULTS: The prevalence of CT was 7.4% (51 of 691). A risk score for predicting CT infection, with scores 0 to 6, was derived from participants' age, alcohol use, and presence of bacterial vaginosis. The prediction model yielded an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.78 (95% confidene interval [Cl], 0.72-0.84). A cutoff of ≤2 versus >2 identified 31.8% of women as higher risk with moderate sensitivity (70.6%; 95% Cl, 56.2-71.3) and specificity (71.3%; 95% Cl, 67.7-74.5). The bootstrap-corrected area under the receiver operating curve was 0.77 (95% Cl, 0.72-0.83). CONCLUSIONS: In similar populations of women planning pregnancies, this type of risk score could be useful for prioritizing women for laboratory testing and would capture most women with CT infections while performing more costly testing in less than half of the population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The sexual health of transmasculine (TM) people-those who identify as male, men, or nonbinary and were assigned a female sex at birth-is understudied. One barrier to conducting HIV- and sexually transmitted infection (STI)-related research with this population is how to best capture sexual risk data in an acceptable, gender-affirming, and accurate manner. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to report on the community-based process of developing, piloting, and refining a digitally deployed measure to assess self-reported sexual behaviors associated with HIV and STI transmission for research with TM adults. METHODS: A multicomponent process was used to develop a digital-assisted self-interview to assess HIV and STI risk in TM people: gathering input from a Community Task Force; working with an interdisciplinary team of content experts in transgender medicine, epidemiology, and infectious diseases; conducting web-based focus groups; and iteratively refining the measure. We field-tested the measure with 141 TM people in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area to assess HIV and STI risk. Descriptive statistics characterized the distribution of sexual behaviors and HIV and STI transmission risk by the gender identity of sexual partners. RESULTS: The Transmasculine Sexual Health Assessment (TM-SHA) measures the broad range of potential sexual behaviors TM people may engage in, including those which may confer risk for STIs and not just for HIV infection (ie, oral-genital contact); incorporates gender-affirming language (ie, genital or frontal vs vaginal); and asks sexual partnership characteristics (ie, partner gender). Among 141 individual participants (mean age 27, SD 5 years; range 21-29 years; n=21, 14.9% multiracial), 259 sexual partnerships and 15 sexual risk behaviors were reported. Participants engaged in a wide range of sexual behaviors, including fingering or fisting (receiving: n=170, 65.6%; performing: n=173, 66.8%), oral-genital sex (receiving: n=182, 70.3%; performing: n=216, 83.4%), anal-genital sex (receptive: n=31, 11.9%; insertive: n=9, 3.5%), frontal-genital sex (receptive: n=105, 40.5%; insertive: n=46, 17.8%), and sharing toys or prosthetics during insertive sex (n=62, 23.9%). Overall barrier use for each sexual behavior ranged from 10.9% (20/182) to 81% (25/31). Frontal receptive sex with genitals and no protective barrier was the highest (21/42, 50%) with cisgender male partners. In total, 14.9% (21/141) of participants reported a lifetime diagnosis of STI. The sexual history tool was highly acceptable to TM participants. CONCLUSIONS: The TM-SHA is one of the first digital sexual health risk measures developed specifically with and exclusively for TM people. TM-SHA successfully integrates gender-affirming language and branching logic to capture a wide array of sexual behaviors. The measure elicits sexual behavior information needed to assess HIV and STI transmission risk behaviors. A strength of the tool is that detailed partner-by-partner data can be used to model partnership-level characteristics, not just individual-level participant data, to inform HIV and STI interventions.},

   abstract = {AIMS: To develop and validate a machine learning (ML) algorithm to identify undiagnosed hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients, in order to facilitate prioritisation of patients for targeted HCV screening. METHODS: This retrospective study used ambulatory electronic medical records (EMR) from January 2015 to February 2020. A Gradient Boosting Trees algorithm was trained using patient records to predict initial HCV diagnosis and was validated on a temporally independent held-out cross-section of the data. The fold improvement in precision (proportion of patients identified by the algorithm who are HCV positive) over universal screening was examined and compared with risk-based screening. RESULTS: 21 508 positive (HCV diagnosed) and 28.2M unlabelled (lacking evidence of HCV diagnosis) patients met the inclusion criteria for the study. After down-sampling unlabelled patients to aid the algorithm's learning process, 16.2M unlabelled patients entered the analysis. Performance of the algorithm was compared with universal screening on the held-out cross-section, which had an incidence of HCV diagnoses of 0.02%. The algorithm achieved a 101.0 ×, 18.0 × and 5.1 × fold improvement in precision over universal screening at 5%, 20% and 50% levels of recall. When compared with risk-based screening, the algorithm required fewer patients to be screened and improved precision. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents strong evidence towards the use of ML on EMR data for the prioritisation of patients for targeted HCV testing with potential to improve efficiency of resource utilisation, thereby reducing the workload for clinicians and saving healthcare costs. A prospective interventional study would allow for further validation before use in a clinical setting.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: History and physical examination findings can be unreliable for prediction of genitourinary tract infections and differentiation of urinary tract infections from sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The study objective was to develop a prediction tool to more accurately identify patients with STIs. METHODS: A retrospective review of 64,490 emergency department (ED) encounters between April 18, 2014, and March 7, 2017, where patients age 18 years or older had urinalysis and urine culture or testing for gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomonas, was used to develop a prediction model for men and women with Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis, or both, and for women with Trichomonas vaginalis. The data set was randomly divided into two-thirds discovery and one-third validation. Groups were assigned through a random number generator. Backward step regression modeling was used to identify the best model for each outcome. RESULTS: With use of age, race, marital status, and findings from vaginal wet preparation (white blood cells [WBCs], clue cells, and yeast) and urinalysis (squamous epithelial cells, protein, leukocyte esterase, and WBCs), the models had areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 for men with N gonorrhoeae or C trachomatis, or both; 0.75 for women with N gonorrhoeae or C trachomatis, or both; and 0.73 for women with T vaginalis. CONCLUSIONS: The model estimated likelihood of ED patients having STIs was reasonably accurate with a limited number of demographic and laboratory variables. In the absence of point-of-care STI testing, use of a prediction tool for STIs may improve antimicrobial stewardship.},

Yet, HCV coinfection was shown to be rare in some Sub-Saharan HIV cohorts, and targeted testing was suggested more efficient for such settings. We studied HCV prevalence among Ghanaian PLHIV, and assessed the external validity of a score to guide targeted testing. This score was initially derived from a Cambodian HIV cohort, and uses as predictors: age, household member/partner with liver disease, diabetes, generalized pruritus, AST, platelets, and AST-to-platelet ratio index. We enrolled 4,023 PLHIV, most from Greater Accra and Central regions, 28.4% were male, median age was 47 years, and high-risk behavior was reported to be rare. HCV seroprevalence was 0.57%, and HCV-RNA was detectable in 0.5%. Sequencing revealed genotype 1(b) and 2(q/r) infections. The discriminatory performance of the score was suboptimal in the Ghanaian setting. The area under the curve was 0.69 (95% CI 0.59-0.79). HCV coinfection prevalence was very low in this Ghanaian PLHIV cohort with reported low-risk of onward transmission. To avoid the cost of screening all PLHIV in similar cohorts in resource-constrained settings, further research to develop better tools/scores to guide targeted HCV testing is needed.},

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a concerning issue, especially in developing and underdeveloped countries, in which environmental factors and other determinants of health play a role in contributing to its fast spread. In light of this situation, machine learning techniques have been explored to assess the incidence of syphilis and contribute to the epidemiological surveillance in this scenario. OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this work is to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models on predicting undesirable outcomes of congenital syphilis in order to assist resources allocation and optimize the healthcare actions, especially in a constrained health environment. METHOD: We use clinical and sociodemographic data from pregnant women that were assisted by a social program in Pernambuco, Brazil, named Mãe Coruja Pernambucana Program (PMCP). Based on a rigorous methodology, we propose six experiments using three feature selection techniques to select the most relevant attributes, pre-process and clean the data, apply hyperparameter optimization to tune the machine learning models, and train and test models to have a fair evaluation and discussion. RESULTS: The AdaBoost-BODS-Expert model, an Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) model that used attributes selected by health experts, presented the best results in terms of evaluation metrics and acceptance by health experts from PMCP. By using this model, the results are more reliable and allows adoption on a daily usage to classify possible outcomes of congenital syphilis using clinical and sociodemographic data.},

METHODS: The risk algorithm was derived in a cohort (n = 468) comprised of symptomatic women in Kigali who sought free screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and vaginal dysbioses at our research site. We used logistic regression to derive a risk algorithm for prediction of NG/CT infection. Ten-fold cross-validation internally validated the risk algorithm. We applied the risk algorithm to an external validation cohort also comprised of symptomatic Rwandan women (n = 305). Measures of calibration, discrimination, and screening performance of our risk algorithm compared to the current Rwandan National Criteria are presented. RESULTS: The prevalence of NG/CT in the derivation cohort was 34.6%. The risk algorithm included: age < =25, having no/primary education, not having full-time employment, using condoms only sometimes, not reporting genital itching, testing negative for vaginal candida, and testing positive for bacterial vaginosis. The model was well calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow p = 0.831). Higher risk scores were significantly associated with increased prevalence of NG/CT infection (p < 0.001). Using a cut-point score of > = 5, the risk algorithm had a sensitivity of 81%, specificity of 54%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 48%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 85%. Internal and external validation showed similar predictive ability of the risk algorithm, which outperformed the Rwandan National Criteria. Applying the Rwandan National Criteria cutoff of > = 2 (the current cutoff) to our derivation cohort had a sensitivity of 26%, specificity of 89%, PPV of 55%, and NPV of 69%. CONCLUSIONS: These data support use of a locally relevant, evidence-based risk algorithm to significantly reduce the number of untreated NG/CT cases in symptomatic Rwandan women. The risk algorithm could be a cost-effective way to target treatment to those at highest NG/CT risk. The algorithm could also aid in sexually transmitted infection risk and prevention communication between providers and clients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are major global public health concerns. Over 1 million curable STIs occur every day among people aged 15 years to 49 years worldwide. Insufficient testing or screening substantially impedes the elimination of HIV and STI transmission. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to develop an HIV and STI risk prediction tool using machine learning algorithms. METHODS: We used clinic consultations that tested for HIV and STIs at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre between March 2, 2015, and December 31, 2018, as the development data set (training and testing data set). We also used 2 external validation data sets, including data from 2019 as external "validation data 1" and data from January 2020 and January 2021 as external "validation data 2." We developed 34 machine learning models to assess the risk of acquiring HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. We created an online tool to generate an individual's risk of HIV or an STI. RESULTS: The important predictors for HIV and STI risk were gender, age, men who reported having sex with men, number of casual sexual partners, and condom use. Our machine learning-based risk prediction tool, named MySTIRisk, performed at an acceptable or excellent level on testing data sets (area under the curve [AUC] for HIV=0.78; AUC for syphilis=0.84; AUC for gonorrhea=0.78; AUC for chlamydia=0.70) and had stable performance on both external validation data from 2019 (AUC for HIV=0.79; AUC for syphilis=0.85; AUC for gonorrhea=0.81; AUC for chlamydia=0.69) and data from 2020-2021 (AUC for HIV=0.71; AUC for syphilis=0.84; AUC for gonorrhea=0.79; AUC for chlamydia=0.69). CONCLUSIONS: Our web-based risk prediction tool could accurately predict the risk of HIV and STIs for clinic attendees using simple self-reported questions. MySTIRisk could serve as an HIV and STI screening tool on clinic websites or digital health platforms to encourage individuals at risk of HIV or an STI to be tested or start HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. The public can use this tool to assess their risk and then decide if they would attend a clinic for testing. Clinicians or public health workers can use this tool to identify high-risk individuals for further interventions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a simple-to-use nomogram for the prediction of syphilis infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Guangdong Province. METHODS: A serial cross-sectional data of 2184 MSM from 2017 to 2019 was used to develop and validate the nomogram risk assessment model. The eligible MSM were randomly assigned to the training and validation dataset. Factors included in the nomogram were determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis based on the training dataset. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used to assess its predictive accuracy and discriminative ability. RESULTS: A total of 2184 MSM were recruited in this study. The prevalence of syphilis was 18.1% (396/2184). Multivariate logistic analysis found that age, the main venue used to find sexual partners, condom use in the past 6 months, commercial sex in the past 6 months, infection with sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in the past year were associated with syphilis infection using the training dataset. All these factors were included in the nomogram model that was well calibrated. The C-index was 0.80 (95% CI 0.76-0.84) in the training dataset, and 0.79 (95% CI 0.75-0.84) in the validation dataset. CONCLUSIONS: A simple-to-use nomogram for predicting the risk of syphilis has been developed and validated among MSM in Guangdong Province. The proposed nomogram shows good assessment performance.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk assessment tool for pregnant women could identify women who would most benefit from preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) while minimizing unnecessary PrEP exposure. METHODS: Data from a prospective study of incident HIV among pregnant/postpartum women in Kenya were randomly divided into derivation (n = 654) and validation (n = 650) cohorts. A risk score was derived using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models and standard clinical prediction rules. Ability of the tool to predict maternal HIV acquisition was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) and Brier score. RESULTS: The final risk score included the following predictors: having a male partner with unknown HIV status, number of lifetime sexual partners, syphilis, bacterial vaginosis (BV), and vaginal candidiasis. In the derivation cohort, AUC was 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], .72-.95) and each point increment in score was associated with a 52% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.52 [95% CI, 1.32-1.76]; P < .001) increase in HIV risk; the Brier score was 0.11. In the validation cohort, the score had similar AUC, Brier score, and estimated HRs. A simplified score that excluded BV and candidiasis yielded an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI, .67-.85); HIV incidence was higher among women with risk scores >6 than with scores ≤6 (7.3 vs 1.1 per 100 person-years, respectively; P < .001). Women with simplified scores >6 accounted for 16% of the population but 56% of HIV acquisitions. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of indicators routinely assessed in antenatal clinics was predictive of HIV risk and could be used to prioritize pregnant women for PrEP.},

   abstract = {Accurate HIV risk assessment among men who have sex with men (MSM) is important to help providers assess risk, and target HIV prevention interventions. We sought to develop an evidence-based HIV risk assessment tool for US MSM that is inclusive of Black MSM. Data from four large longitudinal cohorts of MSM were used to develop (EXPLORE), and validate (VAX004, HPTN061, and HVTN505). These data included visits in which participants self-reported HIV risk behavior and underwent HIV testing. We developed a pooled logistic model for incident HIV infection based on self-reported risk behaviors during the 6 months before each study visit. A total of 4069 MSM were used for the development cohort, and 8047 MSM in the three validation cohorts through 2013. The final model includes age (< 35, ≥ 35); Black race and Latino ethnicity; numbers of HIV-negative anal sex partners; number of insertive or receptive anal intercourse episodes; having 1 HIV-negative partner only; self-reported substance use; and bacterial sexually transmitted infection diagnosis. The model showed good discrimination in internal validation (C-statistic = 79.5). The external validation cohorts also showed good discrimination, with C-statistics of 73.1, 71.0, 71.9 in VAX004, HPTN061, and HVTN505 respectively, and acceptable calibration. We developed and validated an HIV risk assessment tool for MSM, which showed good predictive ability, including among the largest cohort of HIV-uninfected Black MSM in the US. This tool is available online (mysexpro.org) and can be used by providers to support targeting of HIV prevention interventions such as pre-exposure prophylaxis for MSM.},

Here, we additionally suggest less ambiguity concerning the questions addressed. METHODS: We clarify the distinction between two conflated concepts, prediction and explanation, both encompassed by the term "risk factor", and give methods and presentation appropriate for each. RESULTS: Risk prediction studies use statistical techniques to generate contextually specific data-driven models requiring a representative sample that identify people at risk of health conditions efficiently (target populations for interventions). Risk prediction studies do not necessarily include causes (targets of intervention), but may include cheap and easy to measure surrogates or biomarkers of causes. Explanatory studies, ideally embedded within an informative model of reality, assess the role of causal factors which if targeted for interventions, are likely to improve outcomes. Predictive models allow identification of people or populations at elevated disease risk enabling targeting of proven interventions acting on causal factors. Explanatory models allow identification of causal factors to target across populations to prevent disease. CONCLUSION: Ensuring a clear match of question to methods and interpretation will reduce research waste due to misinterpretation.},

   abstract = {In the context of high-dimensional credit card fraud data, researchers and practitioners commonly utilize feature selection techniques to enhance the performance of fraud detection models. This study presents a comparison in model performance using the most important features selected by SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values and the model’s built-in feature importance list. Both methods rank features and choose the most significant ones for model assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of these feature selection techniques, classification models are built using five classifiers: XGBoost, Decision Tree, CatBoost, Extremely Randomized Trees, and Random Forest. The Area under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) serves as the evaluation metric. All experiments are executed on the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset. The experimental outcomes and statistical tests indicate that feature selection methods based on importance values outperform those based on SHAP values across classifiers and various feature subset sizes. For models trained on larger datasets, it is recommended to use the model’s built-in feature importance list as the primary feature selection method over SHAP. This suggestion is based on the rationale that computing SHAP feature importance is a distinct activity, while models naturally provide built-in feature importance as part of the training process, requiring no additional effort. Consequently, opting for the model’s built-in feature importance list can offer a more efficient and practical approach for larger datasets and more intricate models.},

   abstract = {Machine-learning based risk prediction models have the potential to improve patient outcomes by assessing risk more accurately than clinicians. Significant additional value lies in these models providing feedback about the factors that amplify an individual patient’s risk. Identification of risk factors enables more informed decisions on interventions to mitigate or ameliorate modifiable factors. For these reasons, risk prediction models must be explainable and grounded on medical knowledge. Current machine learning-based risk prediction models are frequently ‘black-box’ models whose inner workings cannot be understood easily, making it difficult to define risk drivers. Since machine learning models follow patterns in the data rather than looking for medically relevant relationships, possible risk factors identified by these models do not necessarily translate into actionable insights for clinicians. Here, we use the example of risk assessment for postoperative complications to demonstrate how explainable and medically grounded risk prediction models can be developed. Pre- and postoperative risk prediction models are trained based on clinically relevant inputs extracted from electronic medical record data. We show that these models have similar predictive performance as models that incorporate a wider range of inputs and explain the models’ decision-making process by visualizing how different model inputs and their values affect the models’ predictions.},

   abstract = {Clinical prediction models are useful in estimating a patient’s risk of having a certain disease or experiencing an event in the future based on their current characteristics. Defining an appropriate risk threshold to recommend intervention is a key challenge in bringing a risk prediction model to clinical application; such risk thresholds are often defined in an ad hoc way. This is problematic because tacitly assumed costs of false positive and false negative classifications may not be clinically sensible. For example, when choosing the risk threshold that maximizes the proportion of patients correctly classified, false positives and false negatives are assumed equally costly. Furthermore, small to moderate sample sizes may lead to unstable optimal thresholds, which requires a particularly cautious interpretation of results.},

   abstract = {Background: With the need to expedite the detection of multiple sexually transmitted blood-borne infections (STBBIs), there is an increased demand for digital innovations and tests that improve the efficiency of point-of-care testing in outreach community settings. Multiplexed testing is being offered to at-risk populations by frontline health care professionals. Objective: With this in mind, we evaluated AideSmart! (for health aides or health care workers), an integrated app and platform solution that enables multiplexed STBBI screening at the point of care, for feasibility, preference, accuracy, and impact. With AideSmart!, we provided trained health care workers with the ability to perform rapid multiplexed tests; offer STBBI pre- or posttest counseling; maintain quality assurance of testing; facilitate linkages to care; and enhance health care provider–patient communication, data documentation, and patient engagement through the multiplexed STBBI screening and linkage process. We evaluated the performance of multiplexed tests. Methods: In a cross-sectional study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we recruited at-risk populations in Canada from community-based organizations in Montreal, Quebec, and Saint John, New Brunswick, with unknown serostatus for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and syphilis. Following orientation and pretest counseling with AideSmart!, we performed multiplexed tests, simultaneously screening for HIV, HCV, and syphilis, using 2 rapid investigational multiplexed tests (Chembio for HIV and syphilis and MedMira for HIV, HCV, and syphilis) followed by confirmatory testing from local and national laboratories. Results: Of the 401 participants, all (100%) accepted the AideSmart! multiplexed strategy: 59.4% (148/249) preferred multiplexed rapid tests over laboratory tests, and 56.6% (141/249) preferred receiving same-day test results. Rapid test results were obtained in 15 minutes (vs laboratory tests at 4-24 days). A total of 29 new infections (n=27, 93% HCV; n=1, 3% syphilis; and n=1, 3% HIV) were identified and treated within a week. Feasibility of the strategy (completion of testing and linkages to care) was at 76.1% (305/401). Health care professionals provided positive feedback and emphasized the importance of knowing one’s negative or positive serostatus, especially during a pandemic. Multiplexed rapid tests’ specificity (against laboratory reference standards) exceeded 98% (98.7%-100%) for all pathogens and devices. An electronic reader, used by the Chembio rapid test, enhanced sensitivity (HIV: 100%, 95% CI 79.4%-100%; syphilis: 86.8%, 95% CI 71.9%-95.6% [Chembio] vs HIV: 100%, 95% CI 78.2%-100%; HCV: 90.3%, 95% CI 80.1%-96.4%; and syphilis: 57.9%, 95% CI 40.8%-73.7% [MedMira]). Conclusions: The AideSmart! digital multiplexed rapid screening strategy for health care workers facilitated STBBI testing for multiple STBBIs and arranged for pre- or posttest counseling and rapid linkages with high feasibility and acceptability. Electronic readers enhanced the diagnostic performance of multiplexed biomarker tests. This study generated data in support of digital multiplexed strategies in digitally enabled settings for at-risk populations nationally and worldwide.},
