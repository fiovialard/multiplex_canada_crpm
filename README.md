Clinical sexually transmitted and blood-borne infection risk prediction model using Bayesian methods

This repository contains the code and outputs of a Clinical risk prediction model (CRPM) for sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBI) in Canadian key populations.

The CRPM was developed and validated using Bayesian methods from a cross-sectional study on STBBIs conducted in Canada. The publication describing this model can be found with the following doi: [10.1136/sextrans-2024-056286](https://sti.bmj.com/content/early/2025/06/02/sextrans-2024-056286).
