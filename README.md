Clinical sexually transmitted and blood-borne infection risk prediction model using Bayesian methods  

This repository contains the code and outputs of a Clinical risk prediction model (CRPM) for sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBI) in Canadian key populations. 

The CRPM was developed and validated using Bayesian methods from a cross-sectional study on STBBIs conducted in Canada. To protect participant privacy, the data cannot yet be posted.
